We are happy to announce that the Spatial-Temporal Crowdsourcing Group is established today! Initilized by Prof. Chen, this group has 7 active members now. Hope more members will join soon.

Thanks to the suprising Brithday meeting! :)

This group is focus on topics related to spatial-temporal data processing and crowdsourcing, such as task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing, latency control in general crowdsourcing, copying detection in general crowdsourcing, and data mining/learning for transportation. 

The target is to keep publishing top papers in top CS conferences and contribute to the real world problems. We plan to have a group meeting every Tuesday afternoon, then individually discuss with group members if necessary.

In the first found meeting, we introduce the current studies that the members are working on and the completed papers needed to publish. The next deadline we plan to catch is the 1st Dec for VLDB 2018. We will try to polish the papers of CHEN, Zhao in the next meeting and try to submit them to VLDB 2018.
