Recently, Robin conducted two studies about task assignment on Road Networks. During the experiments, he discovers a series of tool sets and algorithms that can boost the data set preparation and shortest path search.

Thanks for his selfless sharing. We can use that to help our future studies.

For the tips about Robinâ€™s discoveries, please check [the slides]({{ site.base }}/papers/Tips.pdf) of his talk today.
