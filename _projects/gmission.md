Spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a location-based request to workers according to their positions. We focus on batch-based task assignment studies, which means we assign a set of workers to a set of tasks every a period of time. To conduct real world experiments, we designed and developed a general spatial crowdsourcing platform [gMission](http://gmission.github.io), which are opensourced and avaiable on both [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmission-iphone-version/id1071715949?mt=8) and [Android Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hk.ust.gmission). With spatial crowdsourcing, we can conduct a sort of interesting things. One example is 3D reconstruction with photos contributed by workers. Below is an completed example video.
